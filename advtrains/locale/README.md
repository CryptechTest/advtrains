# Translations
Please read this document before working on any translations.

## Getting Started
If there is a translation file for your language (e.g. German), you can edit the file directly. Please read https://minetest.gitlab.io/minetest/translations/#translation-file-format for more information.
If the translation file for your language needs to be created, create it by copying `template.txt` to `advtrains.XX.tr`, where `XX` is replaced by the language code.

## Translation Notes
* Translations should be consistent.
* Replacement sequences (`@1`, `@2`, etc) should not be translated.
